Learning to code new features, learning to code better what it know, optimizing the current state of the game, designing the environment etc. all of them excites me so much. 
  It is obvious because of what i wrote so far and as you now know i like the gaming sector immensely but, i should say that, i would collaborate on almost any game development projects with pleasure. Just let me knoww.")
