  //("Im a self-taught Junior Unity C# Game Developer. Not so talented yet but, game development is my passion and, i constantly try to learn new things or create different projects and practice what i know to boost my skills. Learning to code new features, learning to code better what i know, optimizing the current state of the game, designing the environment etc. all of them excites me so much. 
  It is obvious because of what i wrote so far and as you now know i like the gaming sector immensely but anyways, i want to say that i would collaborate on almost any game development projects with pleasure. Just let me knoww.")
