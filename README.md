  //("Im a self-taught Junior Unity C# Game Developer. Not very talented yet but, game development is my passion and i constantly try to learn new things or create different projects also practice what i know to boost my skills. Learning to code new features, learning to code better what i know, optimizing the current state of the game, designing the environment etc. all of them excites me eminently.
